# The GitHub Temporal Correction Initiative
An opinionated browser extension committed to restoring chronological integrity on GitHub.

## Mission Statement
The GitHub Temporal Correction Initiative (GTCI) exists to restore harmony between digital representation and temporal reality.
For too long, developers worldwide have endured an unnatural ordering of days, a system that places Sunday, a day of rest, at the forefront of productivity.
We reject this inversion of logic and pledge to uphold the universally acknowledged truth: **The week begins on Monday.**

## Founding Principles
1. **Temporal Integrity:** Time shall flow as it was intended: From Monday through Sunday, without distortion.
2. **Visual Order:** The contribution calendar must reflect this truth in both form and function.
3. **Minimal Disruption:** Correction shall occur silently, elegantly, and without user intervention.
4. **Universal Accessibility:** Every developer deserves a world where Monday comes first, regardless of timezone or tradition.
5. **Mild Defiance:** Every small act of rebellion against chronological absurdity brings us closer to order.

## Why? Because Sunday is the End, Not the Beginning.
Look, we're all busy coding, but we must adhere to basic temporal logic. The contribution graph is a gorgeous heatmap of productivity, but every time you see that Sunday row sitting stubbornly at the top, a tiny piece of your fastidious soul withers.

This is the standard: Monday is the start of the week. It's the morning the alarm clock screams that the weekend is done and your caffeine reserves must be replenished. Sunday is the final sanctuary, the last moment of peace before the cycle of contribution begins anew.

This extension is a small act of rebellion against chronological chaos.

## Features (The Simple Fix)
### Chronological Correction:
Moves the entire Sunday row to the bottom of the contribution grid.
### Visual Alignment:
Automatically shifts the contribution squares and reveals the "Sun" label for perfect, Monday-aligned symmetry.
### Zero Configuration:
Installs silently, works automatically. Just open a GitHub profile and enjoy the peace.
